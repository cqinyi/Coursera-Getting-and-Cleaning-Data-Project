Submission for Coursera course on getting and cleaning data


(This code makes use of the "reshape2" R package.) 
This code merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
It then extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
